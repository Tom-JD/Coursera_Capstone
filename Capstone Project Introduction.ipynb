They are looking for which areas to set their fitness centres up in, and are able to adapt the type of gyms they deploy (e.g. could deploy a standard gym in one neighbourhood, a climbing gym in another etc.). They would like data driven recommendations on good areas to deploy their new centres, for a successful, smooth expansion."
